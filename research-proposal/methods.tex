\section{Methods}
    The tasks we need to accomplish can be broadly categorized as follows. \newline

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Application Development
        \item FL Platform Development
        \item User Base Development
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Phase I}
    We will begin by developing an android application.
    Simultaneously, we will develop an end-to-end prototype of the FL platform for 4 devices.
    Once a working prototype is in place, the next step will be to scale it to 20 users and perform thorough end-to-end testing.
    The primary objective is to ensure efficient, seamless deployment of the FL platform on a sufficiently large number of clients.
    \subsection{Phase II}
    Once this is achieved, we will integrate our android application with the FL platform.
    \subsection{Phase III}
    Finally, we will make an effort to scale our application to 100+ users.
