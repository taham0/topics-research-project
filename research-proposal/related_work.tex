    In recent times, there have been several studies done on the algorithms and frameworks to study federated learning. Some of these include: //

    \textbf{FedProx}: An optimized version of the Federated Average algorithm that is more robust than the original, especially in the case of highly heterogenous settings.

    \textbf{FedAdaptive}: This work presents federated versions of adaptive optimizers such as Adam and Adagrad. The use of these can highly improve performance of federated learning

    \textbf{Flower}: a highly developed framework that can support millions of clients using just a few high end GPus.

    A recent paper in 2022 \textbf{“An Experiment Study on Federated Learning Testbed”} performance of federated learning on IOT devices and serves as a place to start when developing federated learning frameworks.

    However, these have only ever been evaluated using LEAF, the benchmark framework for these settings, and is yet to be deployed and analyzed using user data.
