\section{User Base Development}
In order to access the performance and impact of Flower on low end phones, we mainly aimed at creating a sufficient user pool of mainly android phones with 2 to 3 GB RAM. We are approaching the LUMS student body, PDC staff, and MBM workers. However, we have found most devices to be mostly 4GB and above. Hence, we explored options outside LUMS in our individual capacity. As a result of our efforts, we were able to gather around 10 devices (< 4GB RAM) and 5 devices (> 3GB RAM). We expect to gather a much larger number of fast devices, but intend to maintain an appropriate ratio between the two. We are also reaching out to mobile phone vendors who sell used phones. If we are able to reach some arrangement with them, we will be able to leverage many devices with diverse characteristics. \\
